# WIP: rraft
Raft protocol, written in Rust.

## Can LLMs write working Rust code?
This is a bit of an experiment, inspired in part by Avery Pennarun's note re LLMs not writing very good Rust code, posted to the Tailscale blog as [AI changes people](https://tailscale.com/blog/ai-changes-developers), detailed in the section "AI can't write Rust." 

Also potentially interesting, though tangential to this experiment, an arxiv paper was released 2025.02 on performance of LLMs _trained_ specifically on code: [Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03374 "[2107.03374] Evaluating Large Language Models Trained on Code").

I'll probably do a brief write-up of the experiment and post it to my personal site (https://monicaspisar.com).
